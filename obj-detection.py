# TODO: Implement bounding box generation from the MNIST dataset using the 'mnist' module.
# - Use the functions provided by the 'mnist' module to load the MNIST dataset.
# - Process the images and labels to generate bounding boxes for the digits in the dataset.

# TODO: Train the YOLOv3 model from the 'pytorchyolo' module on the generated bounding boxes.
# - Utilize the functions and classes provided by 'pytorchyolo' for training.
# - Adjust the hyperparameters and network architecture as needed for your object detection task.

# Remember to import any additional modules and write supporting code as necessary.
